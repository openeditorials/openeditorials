I"p<p>There is a difference that we realize. It takes a lot to solve the problem lingering within us, the dark demon making the wrong choices. It takes a lot to grow fully into our own wrongness, the unsolvable problems of our twisted and tormented life. Once we have solved the problem of what we want and what we need, we are ready to accept the gift of true love.</p>
