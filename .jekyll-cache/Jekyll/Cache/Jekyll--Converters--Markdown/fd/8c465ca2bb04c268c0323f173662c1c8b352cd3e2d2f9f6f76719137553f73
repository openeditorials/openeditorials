I"¡<p>The escape was inevitable. All my senses were suspended, as I decided to dive deep into my imagination. The monsoon had arrived.</p>

<p>I sat next to window to imagine another world. ‚ÄúYes, I should,‚Äù I lifted porcelain as I approved of my own imagination.</p>

<p>The fragrant tea, as I poured milk onto it, it clouded its surface. ‚ÄúIs the reality clouded by the imagination?‚Äù I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>I shook my head, and I took a sip as my eyes got fixated outside the window.</p>

<p>Outside the window, down the ribbon like path, I saw wind dashed back and forth like a mad hatter, vigorously whipping the branches of the tree while the buds clung on for their dear life.</p>

<p>The next moment I found my eyes fixed on something else.</p>

<p>Someone in the adjacent apartment. I saw, thin, black ribbons of hair suspended in the air as they dried. Like the clump still dripping and glued to her neck, she paid them no mind. She was reading, and her face contort as she did so. I watched all of it in silent amusement.</p>

<p>In another moment I left for another world. The fast paced world of imagination kept on leaving behind the world of reality, and for some reason I was enjoying it.</p>
