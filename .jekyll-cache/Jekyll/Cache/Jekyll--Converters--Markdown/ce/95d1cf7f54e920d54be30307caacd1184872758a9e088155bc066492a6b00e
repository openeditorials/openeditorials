I"ö<p>If we keep it casual, we will save ourselves from wasted time, desire, and self-respect.</p>

<p>We all claim we are looking for pragma love, but in reality what we are searching for is ludus love.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a play that you have to play every day, knowing the opponent is very good at it.</p>

<p>And the catch is, if you donâ€™t keep it playful, youâ€™ll end up losing the game.</p>

<p>The play that keeps us busy. Everyone of us is looking for a window of relief.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s love!</p>
