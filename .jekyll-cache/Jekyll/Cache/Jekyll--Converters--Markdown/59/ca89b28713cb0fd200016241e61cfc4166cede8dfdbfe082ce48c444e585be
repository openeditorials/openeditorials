I"¦<p>In a solitary phase, the color of migratory locust is generally green, camouflaged to blend with the background, and they are normally less aggressive, but when they grow up in a crowded place, strange things happen, there is a mutation, itâ€™s called swarming phase, they become darker, and more aggressive. In order to survive, when there is not enough food for all, they become destructive.</p>

<p>Humans are same, in the world with limitations of desires, in order to satisfy their desires, they go through mutation. And the same way as swarming locusts, they become destructive.</p>

<p>Like swarming locust, I have gone through mutation, and have caused destruction due to the adapted aggression. My kindness and calmness is my choice, and I never intend to use the part of me which is very aggressive.</p>

<p>I rather intend this desire to cower like a caterpillar, and transform into something else called butterfly.</p>
