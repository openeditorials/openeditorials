I"n<p>He flips through the pages of his diary. So many ideas, but he doesn’t know where to start. Looking at the ticking clock he sighs, only 4 hours to write tonight.</p>

<p>“Where did the time go?” he asks to himself.</p>

<p>His eyes fixed on something, not of this world, but on something which he eagerly waits for every night. Another stroke of the ticking clock, and the mid-night silence opens bascule bridge to his imaginative world. Silence is not the absence of sound for him, but a driveway to the streets of his inner city.</p>

<p>The street filled with sodium lights, and mist. The tiny droplets in air, a refreshment to his lungs. He takes a deep breath of relief. As he walks throught the street, he feels pleased, and complete. He waited for this moment entire day. Every night he wanders in the city, and comes back before the bridge is closed down.</p>
