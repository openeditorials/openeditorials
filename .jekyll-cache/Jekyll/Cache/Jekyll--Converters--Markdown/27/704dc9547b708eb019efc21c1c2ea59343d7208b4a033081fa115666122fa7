I"]<p>We come across lot many situations which we don’t like, something which doesn’t feel good to an idea which makes us. The idea can be anything, personally, I don’t like duality. There is nothing wrong in duality as such, it’s just a personal choice. I may aspire to follow it someday, but as of now it doesn’t make much sense to me.</p>
